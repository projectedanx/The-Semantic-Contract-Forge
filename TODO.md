## Phase 2: Platformization & UX

### Template Library Enhancements

- [ ] **Template Management:** Add UI for users to rename or delete their custom templates.
- [ ] **Template Search/Filter:** Enhance the library modal with a search bar and tier filtering controls.

### Editor & Workflow
- [ ] **Syntax Highlighting:** Integrate a lightweight library (e.g., Prism.js or CodeMirror) to add syntax highlighting to the JSON Schema editor.
- [ ] **Session History:** Implement a non-persistent, session-based history of generated prompts and their validation results.
- [ ] **"Fix Until Green" Loop:** Design the UX and logic for an automated re-prompting cycle on validation failure.
