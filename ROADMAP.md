# Project Roadmap: Semantic Contract Forge

This document outlines the high-level strategic roadmap for the SCF project. It is organized into phases, each representing a major stage of development.

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core Functionality & MVP (Completed)

*Goal: Establish a robust minimum viable product that demonstrates the core value of "prompt as contract."*

-   **[COMPLETED]** Tiered system (Starter, Pro, Enterprise) with feature-flagged UI.
-   **[COMPLETED]** Dynamic prompt generation based on user input and tier.
-   **[COMPLETED]** Integration with Gemini API for JSON schema validation.
-   **[COMPLETED]** Core UI/UX for editing and viewing prompt contracts.
-   **[COMPLETED]** Persistence of contracts using browser local storage (Save/Load/Delete).
-   **[COMPLETED]** Robust error handling framework with global boundary and user-facing notifications.
-   **[COMPLETED]** Responsive UI for common screen sizes.
-   **[COMPLETED]** Template Library with pre-defined, tier-locked contracts.

### ‚è≥ Phase 2: Platformization & User Experience

*Goal: Transform the tool into a platform by adding features for reuse, history, and an improved workflow.*

-   **Custom Templates:**
    -   Allow users to save their own contracts as custom templates to the library.
-   **Prompt History:**
    -   Keep a session-based history of generated prompts and their validation results.
-   **Advanced Editor Features:**
    -   Add syntax highlighting to the schema editor.
    -   Introduce a "diff view" to compare contract versions or changes between tiers.
-   **"Fix Until Green" Validation Loop:**
    -   Implement a feature where a failed validation automatically triggers a new prompt asking the AI to correct its previous output based on the validation error.

### üöÄ Phase 3: Collaboration & Enterprise Readiness

*Goal: Build features that support teams and integrate with professional development workflows.*

-   **User Accounts & Cloud Persistence:**
    -   Implement user authentication.
    -   Database integration to save and manage prompt contracts across devices.
-   **Team Workspaces:**
    -   Introduce shared workspaces for teams to collaborate on prompt contracts.
    -   Implement role-based access control (Admin, Editor, Viewer).
-   **CI/CD Integration:**
    -   Develop a REST API for programmatic access to prompt contracts.
    -   Provide official GitHub Actions or webhooks to pull and use contracts in CI/CD pipelines.

### üåå Phase 4: Ecosystem & Intelligence

*Goal: Expand the platform's reach and intelligence, creating a self-improving ecosystem.*

-   **Community Marketplace:**
    -   Launch a marketplace for users to share and monetize their PRP templates.
-   **Prompt Analytics:**
    -   Introduce a dashboard for analyzing prompt performance, including success rates, token usage, and latency.
-   **A/B Testing Framework:**
    -   Provide tools for users to rigorously test different prompt variations.
-   **Multi-Model Support:**
    -   Integrate with other leading LLMs to allow users to test their contracts for cross-model compatibility.
