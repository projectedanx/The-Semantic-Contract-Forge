# The Semantic Contract Forge (SCF)

**Elevating Prompts to Verifiable, Executable Specifications.**

The Semantic Contract Forge (SCF) is an advanced platform for **Promptware Engineering**. It treats every prompt not as a simple instruction, but as a formal, auditable contract bound by machine-readable verification protocols. This approach ensures that AI-generated outputs are reliable, compliant, and aligned with precise requirements.

Built on the principles of **Design by Contract (DbC)**, the SCF enables developers and teams to create **Product-Requirements Prompts (PRPs)** that function as executable specifications, complete with preconditions, postconditions, and strict output schemas.

## ‚ú® Features

The Forge is structured into tiers, offering progressively powerful features for different use cases.

### Core Features

-   **Tiered System:** Progress from basic prompts to enterprise-grade governance.
    -   **Starter Tier:** CRISP Framework templates.
    -   **Pro Tier:** Pre/Postconditions and JSON Schema Enforcement.
    -   **Enterprise Tier:** Constitutional AI and governance constraints.
-   **Dynamic Prompt Generation:** Automatically builds a structured, high-fidelity prompt based on your inputs.
-   **Gemini-Powered Validation:** For Pro and Enterprise tiers, validates a sample AI output against your defined JSON schema.
-   **Save & Load Contracts:** Persist your prompt contracts in the browser's local storage for later use.
-   **Template Library:** Kickstart your work by loading pre-defined, best-practice templates for common use cases like generating React components or secure SQL queries.

### Error Handling & Stability

-   **Global Error Boundary:** The application is wrapped in an error boundary, preventing crashes from unhandled errors and providing a user-friendly recovery screen.
-   **Centralized Logging:** A unified logging service captures structured error information for easier debugging and future integration with monitoring tools.
-   **User-Facing Toasts:** Non-critical errors (e.g., API failures) are communicated to the user via non-intrusive toast notifications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
-   **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`)
-   **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`)
-   **Persistence:** Browser Local Storage

## üöÄ How It Works

1.  **Select a Tier:** Choose the tier that matches your project's complexity and compliance needs.
2.  **Define the Contract:** Either fill out the fields in the **Prompt Contract Editor** from scratch, or kickstart your work by selecting a pre-built contract from the **Template Library**.
3.  **Save Your Work:** Use the "Save" button to name your contract and store it locally. You can create new contracts or load existing ones at any time.
4.  **Generate the Prompt:** The SCF automatically assembles a meticulously structured prompt based on your inputs and selected tier.
5.  **Validate the Output:** For Pro and Enterprise tiers, use the **"Validate Output with Gemini"** feature. This sends the contract to the Gemini API and verifies its sample output against your defined JSON schema.
6.  **Iterate and Deploy:** Use the validated, high-fidelity prompt in your applications, confident that it will produce the desired output structure.

## Ê†∏ÂøÉÊ¶ÇÂøµ (Core Concepts)

-   **Product-Requirements Prompt (PRP):** A highly-structured prompt that serves as an executable specification for an AI's task, detailing not just *what* to do, but the *conditions* and *constraints* under which it must operate.
-   **Design by Contract (DbC):** A software design methodology that uses preconditions, postconditions, and invariants to ensure code correctness. SCF applies this principle to prompt engineering.
-   **Semantic Integrity Constraints (SICs):** Rules embedded within a prompt that mandate adherence to specific standards, such as using only approved UI components, following a coding style guide, or avoiding certain functions.
