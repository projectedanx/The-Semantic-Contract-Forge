# The Semantic Contract Forge (SCF)

**Elevating Prompts to Verifiable, Executable Specifications.**

The Semantic Contract Forge (SCF) is an advanced platform for **Promptware Engineering**. It treats every prompt not as a simple instruction, but as a formal, auditable contract bound by machine-readable verification protocols. This approach ensures that AI-generated outputs are reliable, compliant, and aligned with precise requirements.

Built on the principles of **Design by Contract (DbC)**, the SCF enables developers and teams to create **Product-Requirements Prompts (PRPs)** that function as executable specifications, complete with preconditions, postconditions, and strict output schemas.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm
-   A Google Gemini API Key

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/semantic-contract-forge.git
    cd semantic-contract-forge
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Google Gemini API key:
    ```
    API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    ```
    *Note: The application uses Vite, which automatically loads environment variables from `.env` files.*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### Available Scripts

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
-   `npm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript and builds the application for production.
-   `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase for potential errors.
-   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for previewing.

## ‚ú® Features

The Forge is structured into tiers, offering progressively powerful features for different use cases.

### Core Features

-   **Tiered System:** Progress from basic prompts to enterprise-grade governance.
    -   **Starter Tier:** CRISP Framework templates.
    -   **Pro Tier:** Pre/Postconditions and JSON Schema Enforcement.
    -   **Enterprise Tier:** Constitutional AI and governance constraints.
-   **Dynamic Prompt Generation:** Automatically builds a structured, high-fidelity prompt based on your inputs.
-   **Gemini-Powered Validation:** For Pro and Enterprise tiers, validates a sample AI output against your defined JSON schema.
-   **Save & Load Contracts:** Persist your prompt contracts in the browser's local storage for later use.
-   **Template Library:** Kickstart your work by loading pre-defined, best-practice templates. You can also save your own contracts as custom templates.

### Error Handling & Stability

-   **Global Error Boundary:** The application is wrapped in an error boundary, preventing crashes from unhandled errors and providing a user-friendly recovery screen.
-   **Centralized Logging:** A unified logging service captures structured error information for easier debugging.
-   **User-Facing Toasts:** Non-critical errors (e.g., API failures) are communicated to the user via non-intrusive toast notifications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

-   **Framework:** React with Vite
-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
-   **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`)
-   **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useContext`)
-   **Persistence:** Browser Local Storage

## üìñ How It Works

1.  **Select a Tier:** Choose the tier that matches your project's complexity.
2.  **Define the Contract:** Fill out the fields in the **Prompt Contract Editor**, or select a pre-built template from the **Template Library**.
3.  **Save Your Work:** Use the "Save As..." button to name your contract and store it locally. You can create new contracts or load existing ones from the dropdown.
4.  **Generate the Prompt:** The SCF automatically assembles a meticulously structured prompt based on your inputs.
5.  **Validate the Output:** For Pro/Enterprise tiers, use the **"Validate Output with Gemini"** feature to verify the AI's sample output against your defined JSON schema.
6.  **Iterate and Deploy:** Use the validated, high-fidelity prompt in your applications.

## Ê†∏ÂøÉÊ¶ÇÂøµ (Core Concepts)

-   **Product-Requirements Prompt (PRP):** A highly-structured prompt that serves as an executable specification for an AI's task, detailing not just *what* to do, but the *conditions* and *constraints* under which it must operate.
-   **Design by Contract (DbC):** A software design methodology that uses preconditions, postconditions, and invariants to ensure code correctness. SCF applies this principle to prompt engineering.
-   **Semantic Integrity Constraints (SICs):** Rules embedded within a prompt that mandate adherence to specific standards, such as using only approved UI components or following a coding style guide.
